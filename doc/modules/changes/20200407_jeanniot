New: I added a Fibonacci spiral sampling scheme to the 'gravity point values'
postprocessor, which produces a uniformly distributed map. It can only be used
for global sampling. This sampling scheme is based on the Fibonacci suit and
generates a user defined number of sampling locations per radius rather than
the longitude-latitude grid used for the default non-uniform map sampling
scheme.
