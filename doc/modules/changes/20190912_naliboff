New: There is a new model in the MaterialModel::Rheology namespace for material behavior
that depends on finite strain. At present, the functionality in this
model deals strictly with strain softening behavior, which was 
transferred from the visco plastic material model. However, in the future 
other material models can use this functionality without duplicating code.
