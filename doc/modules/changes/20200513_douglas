New: Modified benchmark of elastic stress build-up in a viscoelastic cantilever flexing under its own weight.
     The boundary conditions are modified to have an open top and bottom, which allows the ambient fluid to be more
     readily displaced while the cantilever flexes. Four python scripts are included which create various plots that are
     useful for comparison to an analytic solution from Geodynamics, Turcotte and Schubert. These 4 scripts plot: 
     1) The stress profile near the attachment point of the beam 
     2) The maximum/minimum stress with time
     3) The maximum deflection with time
     4) The shape of the beam when it is at its maximum flexed state.
