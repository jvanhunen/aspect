New: There is now a new approximation for the compressible convection
models that is called 'projected density field'. This approximation is
more accurate (but also more non-linear) than the existing approximation
ALA, and isentropic compression. The details of the approximation are
described in an article currently in review in Geophysical Journal
International (Gassmoeller, et al., 2019).
