Fixed: The 'AsciiDataLookup' class had a bug that caused models to crash
if they loaded new non-equidistant data files after a previous file was
already loaded. This could only happen when using the 'ascii data' plugins for
boundary conditions with time-dependent non-equidistant data files. This is
fixed now.
