Changed: The viscoelastic plastic material has been reordered so
that the viscoelastic viscosity is calculated prior to yielding
and viscoelastic stresses are taken into account when comparing
the current stress against the plastic yield stress. This approach
is consistent with the approach outlined in Moresi et al., 2003,
Journal of Computational Physics, v. 184, p. 476-697.
