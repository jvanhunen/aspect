New: Added flexibility to the parse_map_to_double_array input method. The new
input method will allow a single value for a given key (e.g. density of a
composition), even if multiple values (e.g. for different phases) are expected.
The single value will be expanded to be the same for all values associated with
that key. For examples of applying this in a input file, see the test
visco_plastic_phases.
