New: Any material model using the strain_dependent rheology
module now has the option to track plastic strain in a 
compositional field where the initial plastic strain is removed.
To use this option, users must include a compositional field
with the name 'noninitial_plastic_strain'. This feature will be
useful in models where the initial plastic strain field is used
to localize deformation, but may then mask the initial stages of 
fault growth.
