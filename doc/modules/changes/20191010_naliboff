New: There is a new model in the MaterialModel::Rheology namespace for plastic
material behavior based on the Drucker Prager yield criterion. This functionality
replaces existing functionality in MaterialUtilities and is currently used in the 
visco plastic, drucker prager, and dynamic friction material models.
