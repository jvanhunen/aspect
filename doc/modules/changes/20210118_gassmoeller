New: There is a new nullspace removal option called 'net surface rotation',
which removes the net rotation of the surface. This can be useful to compare
plate velocities on a sphere with plate reconstructions in a no net rotation
reference frame. Additionally, the 'rotation statistics' postprocessor was
extended to also compute the net surface rotation.
