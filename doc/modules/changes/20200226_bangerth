Fixed: We used to output the entire statistics file at the end of each
time step and overwrite its previous content. But these files can be
large (in the tens of megabytes) and this could put a significant
strain on the file system for simulations that did a large number of
time steps with relatively small meshes (and consequently a short time
between time steps). The new scheme now implemented only writes
incremental updates to the statistics file.
