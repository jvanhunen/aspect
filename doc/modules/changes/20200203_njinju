Changed: The reading of the ascii data file in the "adiabatic boundary" plugin (initial temperature model) was initially using the mid-point approach. Now it has been changed to use the existing ascii-data functionality.
Existing parameter files and data files for the "adiabatic boundary" plugin will have to be checked and converted to the new format.
