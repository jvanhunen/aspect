Changed: There is now a general class
`MaterialModel::Utilities::PhaseFunction` that can be used to model
phase transitions using a smooth phase function. The class allows one or
more transitions for each composition and the background material. As a
consequence the syntax for the 'latent heat' material model has changed if
more than one composition or more than one phase transition is used.
Please refer to the documentation of the `Phase transition depths` parameter
for the new syntax.
