Changed: The sampling scheme names 'map' and 'list' of the 'gravity point values'
postprocessor were renamed more appropriately 'uniform distribution' 
and 'list of points'. The previous names still work for backward compatibility.
Additionally, this postprocessor now computes the theoretical gravity potential 
in addition to the existing outputs.
