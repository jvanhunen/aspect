New: Added a new parameter 'Temperature method' that controls how the
temperature equation is solved. The parameter works analogous to the
'Compositional field method' parameter, and the current options are 'field'
(the default temperature equation), and 'prescribed field', which allows the
material model to fill a PrescribedTemperatureOutputs object that will set the
temperature field to defined values. This parameter is mostly useful if you
have other ways to determine temperature than by solving the temperature
equation (e.g. deriving from a compositional field, or from particles).
