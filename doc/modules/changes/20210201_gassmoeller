Changed: ASPECT now uses a mapping caching strategy provided by deal.II for
models with curved cells (spherical shells, chunk, sphere) as long as there is
no mesh deformation. The new mapping drastically decreases the time for sorting
particles, but has little influence (as far as we know) on other timings, and
has no influence on the accuracy.
