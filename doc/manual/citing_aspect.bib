@misc{Bangerth2017,
abstract = {This release includes the following changes:


	New: Choice between different formulations for the governing equations including Boussinesq and anelastic liquid approximation.
	New: Melt transport (two-phase flow).
	Particles: new generators, ghost exchange, performance improvements, interpolation to fields.
	New: Nondimensional material model for incompressible (using the Boussinesq approximation) and compressible computations (with ALA or TALA) for nondimensionalized problems. This can be used for benchmark problems like Blankenbach, King, etc..
	New: Optional DG method for temperature/composition.
	Adiabatic conditions: rework, now includes a reference density profile
	Free surface: overhaul.
	New cookbooks: continental extension, finite strain.
	New benchmarks: TanGurnis, Blankenbach, King.
	New: viscoplastic material model.
	Material model interface cleanup.
	Assembly performance improvements.
	New: memory statistics postprocessor.
	New: initial topography plugins.
	Many other fixes and small improvements.},

@article{Rose2017a,
abstract = {Mass redistribution in the convecting mantle of a planet causes perturbations in its moment of inertia tensor. Conservation of angular momentum dictates that these perturbations change the direction of the rotation vector of the planet, a process known as true polar wander (TPW). Although the existence of TPW on Earth is firmly established, its rate and magnitude over geologic time scales remain controversial. Here we present scaling analyses and numerical simulations of TPW due to mantle convection over a range of parameter space relevant to planetary interiors. For simple rotating convection, we identify a set of dimensionless parameters that fully characterize true polar wander. We use these parameters to define timescales for the growth of moment of inertia perturbations due to convection and for their relaxation due to true polar wander. These timescales, as well as the relative sizes of convective anomalies, control the rate and magnitude of TPW. This analysis also clarifies the nature of so called “inertial interchange” TPW events, and relates them to a broader class of events that enable large and often rapid TPW. We expect these events to have been more frequent in Earth's past.},
